1. one service per container
2. build context should be small, can use dockerignore
3. install only the things you need
4. less layers, try to optimize your commands, if you can run everything in a comand, do not write several commands
    RUN \
        option1 && \
        option2 && \
        option3

    and also use environment variables for things you repeat a lot
